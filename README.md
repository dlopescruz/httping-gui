This monitoring application, developed in Python, offers a practical and efficient solution for testing the availability and performance of web applications. It's designed as a lightweight, user-friendly command-line tool, perfect for developers and system administrators.

A key advantage of this project is its simplified distribution for Windows. Although the programming language is Python, the application is delivered to the end-user as a standalone executable file (.exe). This eliminates the need for the user to install Python or configure external libraries, making the process incredibly easyâ€”all you have to do is run the file.

How It Works
At its core, the program sends HTTP requests to a specific URL, simulating a browser's access. Upon receiving a response, it checks the HTTP status code (a 200 code, for example, indicates success), measures the time the application took to respond, and displays this information clearly in the terminal. This provides a more accurate diagnosis of the application's health and performance than a simple network ping test.

In short, this Python web application "ping" tool combines the flexibility and power of a robust language with the convenience of a single-file distribution, ensuring that anyone on Windows can use it without any hassle.
